# Euchre
If you aren't familiar with Euchre, it is a four player trick-taking card game (similar to Bridge). You can read the official rules of Euchre [here.](https://bicyclecards.com/how-to-play/euchre/)

## How it Works
This project allows you to select the number of players who wish to play and play a full game of Euchre in the command line. If less than 4 players are playing, the remaining players will be computer players. Users can select what action they want to take from a menu that displays valid choices according to Euchre rules. The game continues until a team wins, at which point the player(s) can decide if they wish to play again.

## Future Plans
I built Euchre with the MVC design pattern in mind to make the logic extendable. This will allow me (or you!) to eventually build a front-end to this command line application without completely rebuilding the logic.

Additionally, as of now this version of Euchre does not allow players to "go alone." While this is very uncommon in a real-world game of Euchre, I plan on eventually adding this functionality so that it will be just like playing a game against your friends!
